# RUST-HDF5

Bindings to the HDF5 library to read and write scientific data files with Rust

## Status

This project is stalled and will not be further developed. For [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/)-binding please have a look at the [hdf5-rs](https://github.com/aldanor/hdf5-rs) project.

## Build

As rustpkg is currently deprecated ([ref](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-January/008224.html)), makefiles are used to build the Rust binding library.

Simply type 
```
make
```
to build the binding library and
```
make test
```
to run additional tests.
